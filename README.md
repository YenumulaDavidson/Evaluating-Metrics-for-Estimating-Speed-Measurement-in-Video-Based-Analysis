# EVALUATING-METRICS-FOR-ESTIMATING-SPEED-MEASUREMENT-IN-VIDEO-BASED-ANALYSIS
This study estimates vehicle speed in traffic videos without sensors using virtual entry lines, YOLOv3, DeepSORT, optical flow, and tracking algorithms. Speed is derived from pixel displacement and frame count. A Flask-based UI with login supports testing. Multiple YOLO models are evaluated.
